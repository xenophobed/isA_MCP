        # Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        
        Artificial intelligence is transforming how we approach complex problems. Machine learning algorithms can now process vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions.
        
        ## Deep Learning Applications
        
        Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing. Neural networks with millions of parameters can now understand images and text with human-like accuracy.
        
        ## Cooking Recipe: Chocolate Cake
        
        Here's a delicious chocolate cake recipe that serves 8 people. Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, eggs, and butter. Bake at 350¬∞F for 30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
        
        ## AI in Healthcare
        
        Artificial intelligence is making significant impacts in healthcare through medical imaging analysis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment recommendations.
        
        ## Weather Forecast
        
        Tomorrow's weather will be partly cloudy with temperatures reaching 75¬∞F. There's a 20% chance of rain in the afternoon. Don't forget your umbrella.
        
        ## Machine Learning Algorithms
        
        Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. Each has its strengths for different types of problems.
