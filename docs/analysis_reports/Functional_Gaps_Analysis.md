3. âœ… Email-based member invitations
4. âœ… Basic billing with Stripe
5. âœ… Email notifications (welcome, billing)

4. Enhanced security

**Total Development Time for MVP**: 2-3 weeks
**Total Development Cost**: $15K-$25K

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Week 1**: Email system + user onboarding flow
2. **Week 2**: Email invitations + admin panel  
3. **Week 3**: Rate limiting + basic frontend
